Apiary list

This project has to be easy to run, so it has only few things to do;
First you have to copy db to your environment. I left two files in main folder of repository. 
One with just a structure od DB is called: "empty-db-just-structure.sql".
Second one has also dummy content,and is called: "db-with-data.sql".
It's your choice to pick one that you prefer.

After copying and starting db, it's only few steps to start the App:
1- clone this repository;
2- install needed dependencies "npm i "
3- start the application "npm run start:dev" or "npm run start"


But why bother. You can also check how does it work on my "Replit". The code is slightly diferent, and I will not refactor it anymore. So if you want to see clean, fresh code, github is your place, but if you want to check how does it look first, that's the place to visit.

You might have to wait for a while, for it to start, but most functionalities should work nice.
Also there's "Admin/Information" button on menu, where you can see detailed explanation for the app.
