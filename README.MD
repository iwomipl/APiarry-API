Apiary list

This project has to be easy to run, so it has only few things to do;
First you have to copy db to your environment. I left two files in main folder of repository. 
One with just a structure od DB is called: "empty-db-just-structure.sql".
Second one has also dummy content,and is called: "db-with-data.sql".
It's your choice to pick one that you prefer.

After copying and starting db, it's only few steps to start the App:
1- clone this repository;
2- install needed dependencies "npm i "
3- create config.ts file, and fill it with information of your DB and server
4- start the application "npm run start:dev" or "npm run start"


Hive Fun and Bee Happy!
